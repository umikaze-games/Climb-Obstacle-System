# Climb-Obstacle-System

A Unity-based prototype project implementing a 3D parkour and climbing system.  
This project demonstrates core mechanics for character climbing, vaulting, and interacting with obstacles in a 3D environment.

## Features

- **Real-time environment detection** using Raycast and collision checks  
- **Modular action management:** each action (climb, vault, etc.) implemented as separate modules/classes  
- **State pattern** for safe and extendable action transitions  
- **Player input and dynamic control:** actions respond smoothly to player operation  
- **Camera control** for immersive 3D movement experience  
- **Debug visualizations** using Unity Gizmos
